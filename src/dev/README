If you are installing on a Windows system run 
winsetup

If you are installing on a Mac run
./macsetup

If you are installing on a Linux system run

After you have done the set up required for your system
you need to set the address of your robot

Two ways exist 
1) changing the value of the ADDRESS variable in SVR.h
this will fix the address at compile time
the other
2) if the ADDRESS variable in SVR.h is NULL
the system will get the address from the SVR_ADDRESS
environment variable


cd src

edit the SVR.h file and set the ADDRESS variable value
 

make

once make succeeds you can then make the examples

cd .. 
cd examples
make


I have been experimenting with SDL graphics for the Surveyor
if you are set up for SDL 
then

make SDL 

will construct a simple picture viewer and a test program
